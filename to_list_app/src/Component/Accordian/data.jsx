      "question": "What does a React developer do?",
      "answer": "A React developer specializes in building user interfaces using the React JavaScript library. They create reusable components, manage application states, optimize performance, and ensure the frontend is responsive and efficient. React developers often work closely with backend developers and designers to deliver seamless web applications."
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "question": "What skills are required to become a React developer?",
      "answer": "Key skills include proficiency in JavaScript, understanding of ES6+, HTML, CSS, React fundamentals (components, props, state), Redux or other state management tools, and knowledge of APIs and version control systems like Git."
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "question": "Why should I use React for my project?",
      "answer": "React is efficient, component-based, and supported by a large community. It allows for reusable UI components, faster rendering using a virtual DOM, and seamless integration with other libraries or frameworks."
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "question": "Is React good for building large-scale applications?",
      "answer": "Yes, React is highly scalable. Its modular approach with reusable components and strong ecosystem tools like Redux and React Router make it suitable for large and complex applications."
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "question": "What is the difference between React and React Native?",
      "answer": "React is used for building web applications, while React Native is used for building mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same React concepts."
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "question": "What is JSX in React?",
      "answer": "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files, making the code more readable and easier to write."
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "question": "How does state management work in React?",
      "answer": "State in React is used to manage dynamic data in components. It can be managed locally with React’s built-in useState hook or globally using tools like Redux, Context API, or Zustand."
    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "question": "What are React hooks?",
      "answer": "Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef."
    },
    {
      "id": "9",
      "question": "How is React different from other frameworks like Angular or Vue?",
      "answer": "React is a library focused on building UIs, while Angular is a full-fledged framework. React offers more flexibility and is easier to integrate with other tools compared to Angular or Vue."
    },
    {
      "id": "10",
      "question": "What are components in React?",
      "answer": "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are independent, reusable pieces of UI that can be either functional or class-based."
    },
    {
      "id": "11",
      "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React?",
      "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to efficiently update and render components by only changing what’s necessary in the actual DOM."
    },
    {
      "id": "12",
      "question": "How does React handle forms?",
      "answer": "React handles forms using controlled components, where form data is managed by the component’s state. This allows validation and user input to be handled more dynamically."
    },
    {
      "id": "13",
      "question": "What is prop drilling in React?",
      "answer": "Prop drilling occurs when data is passed through multiple levels of components unnecessarily. This can be mitigated using Context API or state management libraries."
    },
    {
      "id": "14",
      "question": "Can React be used with TypeScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, React can be used with TypeScript for better type safety, enhanced code completion, and improved development experience."
    },
    {
      "id": "15",
      "question": "What is SSR in React?",
      "answer": "SSR stands for Server-Side Rendering. It allows React components to be rendered on the server and sent to the browser as fully rendered HTML, improving performance and SEO."
    },
    {
      "id": "16",
      "question": "How do you optimize performance in a React app?",
      "answer": "Performance can be optimized using techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, memoization with React.memo or useMemo, and efficient state management."
    },
    {
      "id": "17",
      "question": "What is Redux and how is it used in React?",
      "answer": "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. In React, it's used to manage global state using actions, reducers, and a central store."
    },
    {
      "id": "18",
      "question": "How does routing work in React?",
      "answer": "Routing in React is handled using libraries like React Router, which allows navigation between different components based on the URL path."
    },
    {
      "id": "19",
      "question": "Is React SEO-friendly?",
      "answer": "React can be SEO-friendly when used with server-side rendering (e.g., with Next.js), as it ensures that the content is available to search engines before JavaScript is fully executed."
    },
    {
      "id": "20",
      "question": "What are the best practices for writing React code?",
      "answer": "Best practices include using functional components, keeping components small and reusable, using hooks wisely, maintaining a consistent folder structure, and writing clean, readable code."
